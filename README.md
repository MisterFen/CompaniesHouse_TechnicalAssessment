The core approach for this assessment has been implement the framework for an automated test suite, and some initial tests.
Accompanied by documentation stating the plan on how to expand upon it.

The end result is a Typescript Project with Playwright. Setup with all required configurations needed to run locally, and to be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline.
The code is structured between tests and PageObjectModels. Which are structured to be adaptable and modular in the event of further pages/sections being added/changed in the application.

I will admit that I wasn't able to finish the more technical critical-path test in the timeframe I had, but I'm sure with more time I'd make it a robust addition.
